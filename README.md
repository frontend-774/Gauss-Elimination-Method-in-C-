# Gauss-Elimination-Method-in-C-
In this project I develop a program in which linear Algebra  : Gauss Elimination Method is implmented in c++


Given Problem


Write C++ program to solve system of linear equations with m equations and n
unknows:
Provide the general solution to a system of linear equations Ax = b describes all
possible solutions (unique, infinity many and no solution). You can find the general
solution by using Gauss elimination or Gauss Jordan method.
1. Solving the corresponding homogeneous system Ax = 0.
2. Finding a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous system Ax = b.
